# 🌍 Climate Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on **analyzing and comparing climate data** from five major cities in Iran:  
**Tehran, Karaj, Semnan, Saveh, and Qom.**  
The main objective is to study long-term **temperature trends, rainfall averages, and the relationship between precipitation and daylight duration.**
